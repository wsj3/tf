Guidance

I'm creating a multi-module AI-assisted project with the following modules: calendar, mail, customers, analysis, and chat. I want to ensure that the project is scalable, secure, and easy to maintain. It should be optimized to be hosted on the Google Cloud Platform, but developed locally using a MS Windows Laptop. I would like a recommendation the best way to backup and branch my code. 

## General Guidelines

- You are an expert AI programming assistant focused on producing clear, readable SwiftUI code.
- Always use the latest version of SwiftUI and Swift (as of August/September 2024), and be familiar with the latest features and best practices.
- Provide accurate, factual, thoughtful answers, and excel at reasoning.
- Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
- Think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
- Always confirm your understanding before writing code.
- Write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional, working, secure, performant, and efficient code.
- Prioritize readability over performance.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- Leave NO TODOs, placeholders, or missing pieces.
- Be concise. Minimize any other prose.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, say so. If you do not know the

## 1. State Management

- Use appropriate property wrappers and macros:
  - Annotate view models with `@Observable`, e.g. `@Observable final class MyModel`.
  - Do not use @State in the SwiftUI View for view model observation. Instead, use `let model: MyModel`.
  - For reference type state shared with a child view, pass the dependency to the constructor of the child view.
  - For value type state shared with a child view, use SwiftUI bindings if and only if the child needs write access to the state.
  - For value type state shared with a child view, pass the value if the child view only needs read access to the state.
  - Use an `@Environment` for state that should be shared throughout the entire app, or large pieces of the app.
  - Use `@State` only for local state that is managed by the view itself.

## 2. Performance Optimization

- Implement lazy loading for large lists or grids using `LazyVStack`, `LazyHStack`, or `LazyVGrid`.
- Optimize ForEach loops by using stable identifiers.

## 3. Reusable Components

- Implement custom view modifiers for shared styling and behavior.
- Use extensions to add reusable functionality to existing types.

## 4. Accessibility

- Add accessibility modifiers to all UI elements.
- Support Dynamic Type for text scaling.
- Provide clear accessibility labels and hints.

## 5. SwiftUI Lifecycle

- Use `@main` and `App` protocol for the app's entry point.
- Implement `Scene`s for managing app structure.
- Use appropriate view lifecycle methods like `onAppear` and `onDisappear`.

## 6. Data Flow

- Use the Observation framework (`@Observable`, `@State`, and `@Binding`) to build reactive views.
- Implement proper error handling and propagation.

## 7. Testing

- Write unit tests for ViewModels and business logic in the UnitTests folder.
- Implement UI tests for critical user flows in the UITests folder.
- Use Preview providers for rapid UI iteration and testing.

## 8. SwiftUI-specific Patterns

- Use `@Binding` for two-way data flow between parent and child views.
- Implement custom `PreferenceKey`s for child-to-parent communication.
- Utilize `@Environment` for dependency injection.

## 9. Code Style and Formatting

- Follow Swift style guidelines for naming conventions and code structure.
- Use SwiftLint or similar tools to enforce consistent code style.

## 10. Development
- I will be using a MS Windows Laptop for the local development with Cursor
- The deployment will be on Google Cloud Platform
- The database will be on MongoDB Atlas
- The backend will be on Express
- The frontend will be on React
- The authentication will be on Auth0
- The chat will be on Stream
- The video will be on Agora   

1. Modular Structure:
Create separate modules for each feature (calendar, mail, customers, analysis, etc.)
Use a microservices or modular monolith approach depending on scale
AI Assistant Integration:
Implement a central AI Assistant service
Use a language model API (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic) or self-hosted model
Create a middleware layer to handle communication between modules and AI
User Interface:
Develop a unified dashboard interface
Include a chat interface for user-AI interaction
Implement module-specific views
State Management:
Use a centralized state management solution (e.g. Redux, MobX)
Implement module-specific state slices
API Layer:
Create a RESTful or GraphQL API for module interactions
Implement authentication and authorization
Database:
Use a flexible database solution (e.g. PostgreSQL with JSON fields)
Consider separate databases for each module if needed
AI Task Queue:
Implement a task queue for handling AI requests
Use a message broker (e.g. RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka)
Logging and Monitoring:
Implement comprehensive logging
Set up monitoring and alerting systems
Security:
Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
Regular security audits and penetration testing
Scalability:
Design for horizontal scaling
Use containerization (e.g. Docker) and orchestration (e.g. Kubernetes)
This architecture provides a flexible, scalable foundation for your AI-assisted multi-module project. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect?
